# Face-recognition
Facial recognition is a way of identifying or confirming an individual's identity using their face. 
Facial recognition systems can be used to identify people in photos,videos, or in real-time. 
Facial recognition is a category of biometric security. It is a sub domain of Object Detection, 
where we try to observe the instance of semantic objects.
Cascade Classifiers and HAAR Features are the methods used for Object Detection. 
It is a machine learning algorithm where we train a cascade function with tons of images.
